# Cryptdate

## I. Overview

Cryptdate is a comedic take on both a text-based adventure and a dating sim, except instead of trying to romance other people you're trying to hook up with famous cryptids.
The game features such viable candidates as:
* Bigfoot
* The Lochness Monster
* Mothman
* Dracula
* A Werewolf

and maybe more!

## II. Genre

Cryptdate is more of a text-based adventure than dating sim, but since the dating option is present it also falls under that category. Think of "A Dark Room" but more cooky. It
is obviously also comedic just based on idea alone.

## III. Platform

Cryptdate will be an in-browser game but will be mobile friendly as well. Phone, desktop, and tablet.

## IV. Story

The player is the protagonist (they will input their name at the beginning) who is walking home from work one day when they encounter a number of strange events, each one corresponding
to one of the dating candidates. Depending on which one they choose they will go down a path that leads them to find the corresponding cryptid. The choices they make from then on out
will determine whether or not you die, kill, escape, safely leave, or fall in love. Each path will have their own quips and jokes that lighten the story.

## V. Aesthetics

There will be graphics to the game, pixel art most likely. Probably black and white with some pops of color. The player can choose to leave the game black text on white background or
change to a dark theme with white text on a dark grey background. Text size will be moderate so there's no eye strain.

## VI. Gameplay

On desktop the gameplay will mainly be mouse clicks on buttons but on mobile it will be gesture/touch supported.

### Mechanics

Aside from the initial 5-choice starting option for each route, there will be three options for every decision in the game. Very straight forward.

### Controls

* Mouse
* Touch and/or Gesture

## VII. Screenshots

Coming soon!

## IX. About the developer

My name is Vincent Bennett, at the time of writing this I'm a sophomore Game Design and Development major at RIT. I'm very interested in cryptozoology and horror which is my main inspiration
for this game. I chose this major because I grew up loving video games and decided to learn to code starting in high school as both another way to express myself but also for the utility of knowing
how technology and the internet work. Otherwise, I tend to lean more toward the art side of games, hence why I'm also drawing and making my own assets and graphics for this game! I specialize in
digital art, using drawing programs but I've taken quite the liking to 3D modeling of which I use Maya to do.
