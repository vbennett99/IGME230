            <h3>I. Overview</h3>

                <p>CryptFit is a comedic and creative take on the traditional dress-up game that many people will remember throughout their childhoods.

            <h3>II. Genre</h3>

                <p>CryptFit is a dress-up game.</p>

            <h3>III. Platform</h3>

                <p>CryptFit will be an in-browser game, able to be played in mobile but not necessarily fully supported. Mainly desktop.</p>

            <h3>IV. Story</h3>

                <p>Mothman is getting ready to go on a Cryptdate&trade; and needs your help to pick his outfit!</p>
            
            <!--The player is the protagonist (they will input their name at the beginning) who is walking home from work one day when they encounter a number of strange events, each one corresponding
                to one of the dating candidates. Depending on which one they choose they will go down a path that leads them to find the corresponding cryptid. The choices they make from then on out
                will determine whether or not you die, kill, escape, safely leave, or fall in love. Each path will have their own quips and jokes that lighten the story.-->

            <h3>V. Aesthetics</h3>

                <p>There will be graphics to the game, 2D digital art. The game will be in full color with a simple background but with a fair amount of outfit choices.
                    The player can choose to leave the game black text on white background or change to a dark theme with white text on a dark grey background.
                    Text size will be moderate so there's no eye strain.</p>

            <h3>VI. Gameplay</h3>

                <p>On desktop the gameplay will mainly be mouse clicks on buttons but if it is to be on mobile it will be gesture/touch supported.</p>

                <h4>Mechanics</h4>

                    <p>The player clicks on and drags different outfits onto Mothman.</p>
                        
                <h4>Controls</h4>

                    <li>Touch and/or Gesture</li>

            <h3>IX. About the developers</h3>

                <p>Vince and Jack are both second year Game Design majors at RIT. We both enjoy cryptozoology and doing digital art. Dress up games give us both a
            warm nostaliga that we would like to potentially replicate but in a way that lines up with our new interests.</p>
